PART 4: CATEGORICAL PLOTS
- Write functions for the tasks below
- Update main() in main.py to generate the plots and print statments when called
- All plots should be output as PNG files to `data/part4_plots`

##  UPDATE `part1_etl.py`  ##
# 1. The charge_no column in arrest events tells us the charge degree and offense category for each arrest charge. 
# An arrest can have multiple charges. We want to know if an arrest had at least one felony charge.
# 
# Use groupby and apply with lambda to create a new dataframe called `felony_charge` that has columns: ['arrest_id', 'has_felony_charge']
# 
# Hint 1: One way to do this is that in the lambda function, check to see if a charge_degree is felony, sum these up, and then check if the sum is greater than zero. 
# Hint 2: Another way to do thisis that in the lambda function, use the `any` function when checking to see if any of the charges in the arrest are a felony

# 2. Merge `felony_charge` with `pre_universe` into a new dataframe

# 3. You will need to update ## PART 1: ETL ## in main() to call these two additional dataframes

##  PLOTS  ##
